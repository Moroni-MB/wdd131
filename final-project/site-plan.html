      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a computer science freshman at BYU-Idaho, where I’m eagerly pursuing a future in technology and software development. Born and raised in Mexico, I grew up bilingual in Spanish and English, which has given me a unique perspective on communication and problem-solving. I’m particularly drawn to programming because it’s a field that combines creativity, logic, and continuous learning. I’m certified in both Python and C#, and my coursework has been a rewarding dive into the fundamentals of software engineering. My goal is to grow my expertise and eventually contribute to fields like aerospace technology, where I hope to help further space exploration.
        Outside of academics, I have a range of hobbies that keep me balanced and inspired. I enjoy playing guitar, which challenges me to think creatively and stay focused. Hiking and fishing allow me to spend time outdoors, where I can unwind and get a fresh perspective. Each of these activities complements my programming work by helping me approach problems with patience and creativity. With a diploma from Higley High School and additional training in computer programming from the East Valley Institute of Technology, I’m building a strong foundation for a career in technology. I’m always eager to connect with others in the field and explore new learning opportunities, both academically and personally.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This portfolio showcases the projects I’ve developed, each reflecting my passion for programming and technical problem-solving. As a freshman at BYU-Idaho majoring in computer science, I’ve already had the chance to work on a range of assignments and personal projects, which you’ll find here. Through each project, I’ve applied my certifications in Python and C# to create innovative, practical solutions, from data-processing applications to interactive websites. Each project is more than just a technical exercise; it’s an opportunity for me to think critically about real-world issues, design efficient solutions, and push the limits of what I know.
        As you explore this portfolio, you’ll notice that I enjoy challenges that require both creativity and precision, a trait I’ve brought into my programming from experiences outside the tech field. My interests in aerospace technology and space exploration inspire me to think on a larger scale—focusing on how technology can be used to solve complex problems and make a real impact. While I haven’t yet worked directly in the aerospace field, it’s an area I’m excited to contribute to in the future. For now, I continue to build my programming foundation and strengthen my technical skills. Feel free to explore each project, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback!

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my journey, I’ve had the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills across various fields. I currently work as a phone specialist at the BYU-Idaho Support Center, where I assist students and faculty with technical and administrative inquiries. This role has helped me hone my communication skills and given me the experience of providing effective support in a fast-paced environment. In previous roles, I worked as both a car photographer and lot attendant, where I learned the importance of precision and attention to detail. In my work as a pool technician, I developed practical problem-solving abilities, working independently to troubleshoot and resolve issues on the job. I also served a 2 year mission for my church and taught people in Los Angeles about Jesus Christ in the spanish language.
        Each of these has been invaluable in shaping my approach to programming and teamwork. I’ve learned that strong communication and an adaptable mindset are key to delivering successful results, whether I’m working with code or collaborating with a team. My education includes diplomas from both Higley High School and the East Valley Institute of Technology, where I completed a computer programming course that further fueled my passion for software development. Now, as a computer science major, I’m focused on translating these skills into programming projects that reflect my interests and goals. Looking forward, I’m excited by the idea of combining my technical expertise with my passion for aerospace technology to contribute to space exploration projects. This journey has been full of rewarding experiences, and I’m eager to see where my skills and passions will take me next.
