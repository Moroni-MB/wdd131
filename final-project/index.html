      <p class="intro">
        I’m a computer science freshman at BYU-Idaho, where I’m eagerly pursuing
        a future in technology and software development. I’m particularly drawn
        to programming because it’s a field that combines creativity, logic, and
        continuous learning. I’m certified in both Python and C#, and my
        coursework has been a rewarding dive into the fundamentals of software
        engineering. My goal is to grow my expertise and eventually contribute
        to fields like aerospace technology, where I hope to help further space
        exploration. With a diploma from Higley High School and additional
        training in computer programming from the East Valley Institute of
        Technology, I’m building a strong foundation for a career in technology.
        I’m always eager to connect with others in the field and explore new
        learning opportunities, both academically and personally.

          <h1>Bilingual</h1>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. I grew up
            speaking spanish and when I was 13 years old my family and I moved
            to the US, where I learned english and became bilingual. This has
            given me a unique perspective on communication and problem-solving,
            and has allowed me to use the skills I gained from learning a new
            language, to implement that into learning new computer languages.

          <h1>Communicative</h1>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to serve a 2 year mission for my church in Los
            Angeles, California where I taught people the Gospel of Jesus Christ
            in spanish. As a missionary, I had a partner every hour of the day,
            and I had to learn to communicate effectively to accomplish the
            goals we had set for the day/week/month. Although it was hard
            sometimes, I learned to listen to others, and work with others to
            reach a solution.

          <h1>Creativity</h1>
          <p>
            Outside of academics, I have a range of hobbies that keep me
            balanced and inspired. I enjoy playing guitar, and photography which
            challenge me to think creatively, pay attention to details and stay
            focused. Hiking and fishing allow me to spend time outdoors, where I
            can unwind and get a fresh perspective. Each of these activities
            complements my programming work by helping me approach problems with
            patience and creativity.
